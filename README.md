## Assignment 1: Adapter Pattern - Audio Player

**Folder:** `assignment_1_Audio_Player`

### Description
This assignment demonstrates the Adapter Pattern by adding support for WAV and AAC audio formats in a music player application that only initially supports MP3 files.

### Key Components
- **AudioPlayer.java**: Interface with the `play(String audioType, String fileName)` method.
- **MP3Player.java**: Plays MP3 files.
- **WAVPlayer.java & AACPlayer.java**: Interfaces for WAV and AAC playback methods.
- **AdvancedAudioPlayer.java**: Plays WAV and AAC files.
- **AudioAdapter.java**: Adapts the AdvancedAudioPlayer to the AudioPlayer interface.
- **MusicPlayerApp.java**: Demonstrates the usage of the adapter in a music player application.

## Assignment 2: Bridge Pattern - Remote Control System

**Folder:** `assignment_2_Remote_Control`

### Description
This assignment demonstrates the Bridge Pattern by implementing a universal remote control system that works with various electronic devices (TV, DVD Player, Sound System) from different manufacturers.

### Key Components
- **Device.java**: Interface defining methods like `powerOn()`, `powerOff()`, `setChannel()`, and `setVolume()`.
- **TVDevice.java & DVDDevice.java**: Concrete classes implementing the Device interface.
- **RemoteControl.java**: Abstract class representing a remote control.
- **BasicRemote.java**: Implements basic remote control features.
- **HomeEntertainmentSystem.java**: Demonstrates how a remote control can interact with different devices.

## Assignment 3: Composite Pattern - Menu System

**Folder:** `assignment_3_Menu_System`

### Description
This assignment demonstrates the Composite Pattern by creating a menu system where menus can contain individual menu items or other sub-menus.

### Key Components
- **MenuComponent.java**: Abstract class defining methods for menu items and sub-menus.
- **MenuItem.java**: Represents individual dishes.
- **Menu.java**: Contains other menu components, which can be MenuItems or other Menu objects.
- **RestaurantApp.java**: Builds a multi-level menu system and prints it.

## Assignment 4: Decorator Pattern - Pizza Ordering System

**Folder:** `assignment_4_Pizza_Ordering_System`

### Description
This assignment demonstrates the Decorator Pattern by building a pizza ordering system where customers can customize pizzas with various toppings.

### Key Components
- **Pizza.java**: Interface representing a pizza with `getDescription()` and `getCost()` methods.
- **MargheritaPizza.java & VegetarianPizza.java**: Concrete classes representing basic pizza types.
- **ToppingDecorator.java**: Abstract decorator class for pizza toppings.
- **CheeseTopping.java & PepperoniTopping.java**: Concrete decorators that add toppings to pizzas.
- **PizzaShop.java**: Demonstrates ordering pizzas with multiple toppings.

## Assignment 5: Facade Pattern - Smart Home System

**Folder:** `assignment_5_Smart_Home_System`

### Description
This assignment demonstrates the Facade Pattern by implementing a smart home system that controls various devices such as lights, thermostat, and security systems.

### Key Components
- **Light.java, Thermostat.java, SecuritySystem.java**: Individual smart devices with their operations.
- **SmartHomeFacade.java**: Simplifies the control of multiple devices by encapsulating their interactions.
- **SmartHomeApp.java**: Demonstrates how the facade simplifies operations like `arriveHome()`, `leaveHome()`, and `nightMode()`.

## Assignment 6: Flyweight Pattern - Character Rendering in a Text Editor

**Folder:** `assignment_6_Text_Editor`

### Description
This assignment demonstrates the Flyweight Pattern to optimize memory usage when rendering characters in a text editor.

### Key Components
- **Character.java**: Represents a character with intrinsic (value, font, size) and extrinsic (position) states.
- **CharacterFactory.java**: Manages the character flyweights, ensuring the reuse of existing characters.
- **TextEditor.java**: Uses the CharacterFactory to insert characters and render the document.
- **TextEditorApp.java**: Demonstrates the memory-efficient rendering of large amounts of text.

## Assignment 7: Proxy Pattern - Online Learning Platform

**Folder:** `assignment_7_Online_Learning`

### Description
This assignment demonstrates the Proxy Pattern by creating a virtual proxy for the lazy loading of video lectures in an online learning platform.

### Key Components
- **VideoLecture.java**: Interface defining `getInfo()` and `play()` methods.
- **RealVideoLecture.java**: Loads and plays video lectures.
- **ProxyVideoLecture.java**: Implements lazy loading; the actual video lecture is only loaded when `play()` is called for the first time.
- **OnlineCourse.java**: Contains multiple video lectures.
- **LearningPlatformApp.java**: Demonstrates lazy loading in action, with video lectures loading only when played.
